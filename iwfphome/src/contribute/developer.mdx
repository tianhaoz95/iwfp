## Overview

## App

### Prerequisites

#### Choose an Editor

I personally recommend VS Code. Alternatively you can [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tianhaoz95/iwfp) which is a VS Code on the cloud.

#### Install Flutter

Please see the instructions @ [Getting Started with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

#### Upgrade Flutter to the Latest

The `iwfp` project automatically compiles to all platforms which is only supported through
the latest master channel [@Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

```bash
# we are the cool kids that are always
# at the bleeding edge of the technology
flutter channel master
flutter upgrade
```

### Getting Started

#### Run the `iwfp` app in dev mode

Depending on which platform the app should be running on, a Android Emulator, iPhone/iPad Emulator or a chrome
browser should be running. [@Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) should be able to detect the platform automatically.

```bash
cd iwfpapp
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
