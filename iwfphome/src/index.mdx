## Objective

Nowadays, most people use credit cards and most credit cards feature cashback rewards.

The cashback reward rate is usually 1% universally and 5% (which is a attractive number given the best saving account is only 2% APY) on selected purchases.

To maximize coverage, we can apply for multiple credit cards with various types of cashback reward policies.

However, it won't be fun to juggle between 10 credit cards.
